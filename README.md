Welcome to our official Bug Bounty Program! This program is an experimental program that allows us to encourage and reward members of the Trident community for helping us find and address bugs in accordance with the information below.

<h2 align="left">How to Report</h2>

When reporting a bug on this repository, you are expected to review the list below and ensure you know and understand it. Failure to go through this process will get your issue closed or your account blocked from accessing this repository or any other Trident related repositories.

1. Firstly, you must always check if your issue is already existing, we do not want 10 of the same issue. If your issue is already preexisting, do not create another one.
2. If your issue does not exist, create an issue. To create an issue, follow these steps:
   1. Go to [this link](https://github.com/tridentbot/bugs/issues) and press "New Issue".
   2. Choose whether it is a bot or website report and create a short title.
   3. Then fill out the format, make sure you include as much detail as possible.
   4. Click the "Labels" option and assign the appropriate (see below) labels to your post.
   5. Click "Submit new issue".
